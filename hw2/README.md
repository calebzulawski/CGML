# Assignment 2 - Spirals
### Caleb Zulawski

The implemented perceptron takes 2 inputs (x, y) and returns two outputs (p(t=0), p(t=1)).  It has 2 hidden layers with 20 neurons each.  It is able to classify with near perfect accuracy; classifying the data points near the center of the spiral is nearly impossible since the noise hides any information about which arm the data is from.
